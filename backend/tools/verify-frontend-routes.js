/**
 * Assert that every path the two frontends call is a route the backend mounts.
 *
 *   node tools/verify-frontend-routes.js
 *   node tools/verify-frontend-routes.js --list
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The gateway rewrites legacy paths onto new ones, but only where a rewrite is
 * expressible — it cannot change a verb, fill in a path parameter, or move a
 * request body into a query string. So a large share of the old paths answer
 * 404, and a frontend still calling one gets no error at build time and a blank
 * screen at runtime.
 *
 * `verify-modules.js` proves the backend's own route table is coherent. This
 * proves the CLIENTS agree with it. Together they mean a renamed route breaks
 * CI rather than a page.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS
 *
 *   adminpanel/src/services/endpoints.ts     the staff app's registry
 *   Addaplay/src/services/api/endpoints.js   the player app's registry
 *
 * Both are plain object literals of string paths, so they are parsed with a
 * regex rather than imported — this script must run without either app's
 * toolchain installed.
 *
 * ── AND THE CALL SITES THAT NEVER REACHED THE REGISTRY ───────────────────
 *
 * Checking the registry only proves the registry is right. It says nothing
 * about a component that skipped it and passed a hardcoded legacy path to
 * `apiFetch` — and that check was green for months while thirty-one such calls
 * answered 404, because a correct registry nobody imports routes no requests.
 *
 * So the second pass reads the CALL SITES, resolves each one through the
 * gateway's own legacy rewriter exactly as a real request is resolved, and
 * reports the ones that reach nothing. It also names the ones that reach a
 * route only because a rewrite caught them: those work today and are the
 * migration list, since the rewrite table exists for clients we do not control
 * — provider callbacks and shipped mobile builds — not for our own panel.
 *
 * This pass has the method, so it catches what the registry pass cannot.
 *
 * ── WHAT NEITHER PASS CATCHES ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE SHAPE. A path can resolve, with the right verb, and still hand the screen
 * a body it does not parse — `{success, data}` with the total in
 * `meta.pagination` where the legacy handler returned `{total, data}`. Reaching
 * a route is the floor, not the bar.
 *
 * The registry pass additionally has no method of its own:
 * `/api/v1/admin/user/exchange-rate/rates` accepts POST and has no GET, because
 * READING the rate table is the public route on user-service. The admin screen
 * read from the admin path, the registry pass was happy, and the request 404'd
 * — found by probing a running server. Recording a verb per registry entry
 * would close that; until then a green registry pass means "the path is
 * mounted", not "this call will work".
