/**
 * Rakeback — a share of the house edge, accrued from wagering and claimed.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE CLAIM WAS FOUR UNRELATED STATEMENTS WITH NOTHING HOLDING THEM TOGETHER
 *
 * `Rule.addRakeback`, in full shape:
 *
 *     SELECT rakeamount FROM users WHERE id = $1              -- 1. read
 *     if (rakebackNum) {
 *       UPDATE credits SET usdt = usdt + $2 WHERE uid = $1    -- 2. pay
 *       UPDATE userbonus SET rakebonus = rakebonus + $2, ...  -- 3. record
 *       UPDATE users SET rakeamount = $2 WHERE id = $1        -- 4. reset to 0
 *     }
 *
 * No transaction, no row lock, nested callbacks. Every failure mode this
 * produces costs money in the same direction:
 *
 *   DOUBLE CLAIM. Two clicks arrive together. Both run statement 1 and read the
 *   same balance — say 50. Both credit 50. Both reset to zero. The player has
 *   100 and the house paid twice. There is nothing between the read and the
 *   write to prevent it: no `FOR UPDATE`, no guarded WHERE, no idempotency key.
 *   The socket event `ADD_RAKEBACK` takes no payload at all, so a client
 *   emitting it in a loop is a straightforward drain.
 *
 *   PARTIAL FAILURE. If statement 3 fails, the player has been paid (2) but
 *   `rakeamount` is never reset (4) — so the same balance is claimable again,
 *   and again. If statement 4 fails, identically. Each is its own round trip
 *   with its own `if (err) reject`, and a rejection after statement 2 leaves
 *   the money moved.
 *
 *   NO LEDGER ROW. `UPDATE credits SET usdt = usdt + $2` and nothing else. The
 *   payment does not appear in the player's statement and there is nothing to
 *   reconcile the balance against.
 *
 * ── HOW IT WORKS HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One transaction, opening with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the player's row. A
 * second claim arriving at the same moment blocks there until the first
 * commits, then reads the accrual as zero and is refused. Postgres decides who
 * wins, rather than two callbacks racing.
 *
 * The zeroing is then written with `WHERE rakeamount >= ?` and its row count
 * checked — a second answer to the same question, so that a future change which
 * drops the lock does not silently reopen the double claim.
 *
 * Everything else happens inside that transaction, so a failure anywhere
 * unwinds the zeroing too: the balance comes back rather than vanishing, which
 * is the failure legacy's four independent statements could not avoid.

   * ── WHY THIS IS A ROUTE AND NOT A QUERY IN CASINO-SERVICE ────────────
   *
   * `users` belongs to this service, and so does every other operation on this
   * balance — reading it, claiming it, zeroing it under a row lock. A second
   * service writing the same column from its own callback is how the legacy
   * code ended up with an accrual nobody could account for.
   *
   * casino-service computes the figure, because only it knows the stake and
   * the rate. It posts it here, because only this service writes the column.
   *
   * ── EXACTLY ONCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * The accrual row goes in FIRST, inside the transaction. If `(source, ref)`
   * has been seen the unique index rejects it, the transaction unwinds, and
   * the total is not touched — so a retried internal call, which
   * `ServiceClient` will make on any 5xx or timeout, adds nothing the second
   * time.
