/**
 * The wallet and social socket events — the ones that move money.
 *
 * Every one routes through `WalletService`, which is one transaction with a
 * guarded debit, exact minor units and an idempotency key. Nothing here does
 * its own arithmetic.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * 1. A TIP WAS THREE UNRELATED STATEMENTS
 *
 *     Rule.getClientCoinCredit(id, coin, (senderBalance) => {
 *       if (senderBalance >= amount) {
 *         Rule.reduceBalance(id, amount, coin, (res, error) => {
 *           Rule.addBalance(targetID, amount, coin, (result, err) => {
 *
 * An unlocked read, a compare in JavaScript, then two independent UPDATEs with
 * no transaction between them. Three separate failures:
 *
 *   - two concurrent tips both see the same balance and both pass the check;
 *   - `reduceBalance` is `SET ${coin} = ${coin} - $2` with NO FLOOR, so the
 *     sender goes negative;
 *   - if `addBalance` fails, the sender has been debited and nobody was
 *     credited. The money is gone.
 *
 * ── 2. `C.RAIN` HAS NEVER WORKED ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     client.on(C.RAIN, (data) => {
 *       let { amount, players, room, coin } = data;
 *
 * It is the ONLY handler in `Users/index.js` that does not call `decode(data)`
 * — the other twenty-four do. Destructuring a raw Buffer yields `undefined`
 * for all four fields, so `makeRain` receives `amount = undefined`,
 * `_.toNumber` makes it `NaN`, `if (amount <= 0)` is false for `NaN`, and
 * execution reaches
 *
 *     assert(amount >= 0);
 *
 * which throws. Inside a socket handler with no try/catch, that is an
 * unhandled rejection — which in modern Node terminates the process, taking
 * every connected player with it.
 *
 * So `C.RAIN` is not a feature with a bug. It is a way to restart the server.
 *
 * ── 3. AND RAIN BUILT A TABLE NAME FROM THE MESSAGE ───────────────────────
 *
 *     let table = "chat_" + _.lowerCase(room);
 *
 * Chat really is stored per room — `chat_global` and `chat_brazil` are both
 * real tables — so the concatenation has a legitimate intent. What makes it a
 * defect is that `room` arrives in the message and `_.lowerCase` is a
 * FORMATTING function, not a sanitiser: it converts punctuation to spaces, so
 * an injection is mangled into a syntax error rather than refused. It blocks
 * this by accident, and a room name containing a digit or underscore is
 * mangled too.
 *
 * `CHAT_ROOMS` maps a room to its model, so an unknown room is refused and
 * there is no string to build.
