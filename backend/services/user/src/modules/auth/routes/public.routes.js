   * ── WHY THIS IS CONFIGURABLE, AND WHY IT IS NOT 5 ────────────────────────
   *
   * It was hardcoded at 5/hour to match the socket path. That is too tight for
   * an HTTP form: the limit is per IP, and a household, an office or a mobile
   * carrier is ONE IP to this service. Five signups an hour is a plausible
   * evening for a shared connection, and the sixth person gets a 429 with
   * nothing they can do about it.
   *
   * Twenty an hour still makes bulk creation expensive without punishing NAT.
   * Both values are settable per deployment, because how many people sit behind
   * one address is a fact about the network rather than about the product.
