/**
 * The tables a player's statement is actually spread across.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS LIST EXISTS
 *
 * `combined()` used to read three tables — `deposits`, `fiat_deposits`,
 * `fiat_withdrawals` — and call that a player's history. It is not. Legacy's
 * `GET /api/depositNew` read FOUR deposit tables and `GET /api/withdrawNew`
 * read THREE withdrawal tables, and the new backend writes to all of them:
 *
 *   ccdeposit             crypto checkout orders   modules/crypto
 *   fiat_deposits         manual bank transfers    modules/fiat-deposit
 *   apaydeposits          A-Pay rail               modules/psp
 *   pay_in_transactions   WayPay rail              modules/psp
 *
 *   withdrawals           crypto payouts           modules/crypto-withdraw
 *   fiat_withdrawals      manual bank payouts      modules/fiat-withdraw
 *   apaywithdrawals       A-Pay payouts            modules/psp
 *
 * `deposits` is NOT in that list. Nothing in the new backend writes it — only
 * `legacy/Wallet/Deposit.js` ever did — so a history built from it shows a
 * player none of the deposits they have made since the port. It stays reachable
 * through `cryptoDeposits()` for the historical rows it holds, but it is not
 * what "my deposits" means any more.
 *
 * DESCRIBED, NOT UNION'd. The seven tables agree on neither column names, id
 * types, date columns, nor status vocabulary — `apaydeposits.user_id` is BIGINT
 * and `apaywithdrawals.user_id` is VARCHAR(200), the same integration
 * disagreeing with itself. A `UNION ALL` over that needs a cast in every branch
 * and hides the disagreement inside a 200-line string. Here each rail is
 * queried through its own model and the differences are visible in one place.
 * `modules/deposit-reports` describes the same problem the same way.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/**
 * A provider status as one word.
 *
 * WayPay stores `status` as a SMALLINT, so a player's history would otherwise
 * show "0" next to "pending" and "approved" and mean the same thing three ways.
 *
 * Legacy's version of this mapped 2 onto 'pending'. 2 is FAILED — its own
 * `depositReports` constants say so, and the PSP callback writes 2 on failure —
 * so a failed WayPay deposit read as still in flight.

 * The exact inverse of `normaliseStatus` for the one rail that stores a number.
 *
 * A caller filtering by status names it in words. Comparing the word 'pending'
 * against a SMALLINT column is a Postgres type error, not an empty result, so
 * the WayPay rail needs the word turned back into its number before the query
 * is built. Every other rail stores text and is matched case-insensitively.
 *
 * ONLY the three words `normaliseStatus` can produce are here, deliberately.
 * Accepting synonyms — 'success' for 1, say — would return WayPay rows under a
 * filter whose own answer displays them as 'approved', so a client filtering
 * the list it was given would drop the rows the server just selected. A filter
 * has to match what the caller can see.

 * consuming this has no branch per provider. Legacy returned crypto and fiat
 * under keys shaped differently from each other and the client had a branch per
 * type; that branch is what broke when the shapes moved.
