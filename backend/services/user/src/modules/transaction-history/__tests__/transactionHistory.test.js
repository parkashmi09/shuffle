 * A player's statement, across every rail that holds one.
 *
 * The port read three tables and called it a history: `deposits`,
 * `fiat_deposits`, `fiat_withdrawals`. Four deposit rails and three withdrawal
 * rails exist, and `deposits` is not one of them — nothing in the new backend
 * writes it. So a player who deposited through CCPayment, A-Pay or WayPay, or
 * withdrew crypto or through A-Pay, saw an empty screen, which is
 * indistinguishable from the money having vanished.
 *
 * These tests seed one row on each rail and assert it comes back.
