 * for money that is still in the player's balance — and `reduceBalance` has no
 * floor, so it can also take the balance negative.

 * It asks for the password, and verifies it against the hash before anything
 * moves. That is more than the deposit path did, and it is kept.

   * with — it is the caller's own value, not a fact from the row, and saying
   * so is better than dropping it and letting the panel print an address under
