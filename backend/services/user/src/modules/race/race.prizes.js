/**
 * How a prize pool is split between ranks.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE CURVE IS COMPUTED ONCE AND STORED, NOT RECOMPUTED PER REQUEST
 *
 * The reference computed this in two places: once when an operator saved the
 * config, persisted into `race_config.rank_percentage` and shown to them as
 * "Rank-wise Distribution"; and again, from scratch, on every leaderboard
 * request. The two used different sources for the winner count — the stored
 * column in one, a request-scoped `limit` with its own fallback in the other —
 * so the table the operator approved and the "Reward" column the player saw
 * could disagree, and nothing anywhere would say which was right.
 *
 * `buildRankPrizes` is called on save. `race_config.rank_percentage` is what
 * every reader uses afterwards. The curve a player sees is the curve somebody
 * approved.
 *
 * ── THE SHAPE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. net pool   = pool × (1 − fee%)
 *   2. the podium (ranks 1..3) takes `top3Percentage` of it; the rest share
 *      what is left. With three or fewer winners the podium takes all of it.
 *   3. inside each group the weights are geometric — `decay^0, decay^1, …` —
 *      normalised to that group's share.
 *   4. the LAST rank in each group absorbs the rounding remainder, so the
 *      parts always add up to the whole. Distributing the dust evenly instead
 *      leaves a few satoshi unassigned, which over a year of daily races is a
 *      slowly growing discrepancy nobody can account for.
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
