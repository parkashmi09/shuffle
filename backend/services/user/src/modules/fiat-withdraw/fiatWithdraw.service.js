 * Fiat withdrawals.
 *
 * The money leaves the wallet when the request is CREATED, not when it is paid.
 * That is deliberate and matches legacy: funds a player has asked to withdraw
 * must not also be available to bet with while the request sits in the queue.
 * A rejected request refunds them.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `legacy/fiatwithdraw/controller.js` carried the same SQL injection as the
 * swap controller:
 *
 *   const currencyLower = currency.toLowerCase();
 *   const balanceQuery = `SELECT ${currencyLower} FROM credits WHERE uid = $1`;
 *   const updateQuery  = `UPDATE credits SET ${currencyLower} = ${currencyLower} - $1 ...`;
 *
 * `currency` came from `req.body`, unvalidated, on an unauthenticated route.
 * This is the second of the two injection sites into the balance table.
 *
 * It also read the balance, compared it in JavaScript (`currentBalance < amount`
 * — a float comparison against a NUMERIC read as a string), and then wrote. Two
 * concurrent withdrawal requests could both pass that check.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
