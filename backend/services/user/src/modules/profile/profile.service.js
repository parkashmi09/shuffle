   * to go.
   *
   * ── WHAT IS PUBLIC, AND WHY THAT LIST AND NOT A LONGER ONE ────────────
   *
   * Username, avatar, VIP level, join date and the bet/win counts. NOT email,
   * phone, country, balance, referral code or status — `get()` returns several
   * of those and every one of them is either a contact detail, a location, or
   * money. The test applied was "would this appear next to a name in chat on
   * the site being ported", and nothing outside that list would.
   *
   * `level` is the COMPUTED VIP level, not `users.level`. The two disagree —
   * `users.level` is a column an operator sets and the computed one is derived
   * from lifetime wager — and the platform's own eligibility checks compare
   * against the computed one, so publishing the stored column would show a
   * number the rest of the system does not act on.
   *
   * ── THERE IS NO PRIVACY SETTING TO HONOUR, AND THAT IS A GAP ──────────
   *
   * `userconfig` has `hide_balance` and nothing else; there is no "hide my
   * stats" flag anywhere in the schema, so a player cannot opt out of the
   * counts below. The front-end has a `hideGameData` field in its own shape
   * with nothing behind it. Recorded rather than invented: adding a column
   * here would be this port inventing a product decision.
