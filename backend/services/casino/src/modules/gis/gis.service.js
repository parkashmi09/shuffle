/**
 * Slotegrator (GIS) — the second seamless wallet on the platform, and the one
 * with the most careful signature scheme and the least careful implementation.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * 1. `bal` WAS AN UNDECLARED GLOBAL — BALANCES LEAKED BETWEEN PLAYERS
 *
 * `legacy/gis/controller.js` is not in strict mode, and line 922 reads:
 *
 *     bal = Big(cr.rows[0][col]);          // no `let`, no `const`
 *
 * The declaration that would have made it local is commented out twelve lines
 * below. So `bal` is a property of the module's global object, shared by every
 * request the process handles at once:
 *
 *     request A: bal = A's balance (100)
 *     request A: await ... (yields)
 *     request B: bal = B's balance (5000)
 *     request A: resumes, computes bal.plus(delta) → 4980
 *     request A: UPDATE credits SET usdt = 4980 WHERE uid = A
 *
 * Player A is now holding player B's money. Under any concurrency at all this
 * corrupts balances across accounts, and it does so silently — there is no
 * error, only a wrong number. Nothing here shares state between requests.
 *
 * 2. THE BALANCE WAS WRITTEN AS AN ABSOLUTE VALUE
 *
 *     const setBal = (uid, ccy, val) =>
 *       db.query(`UPDATE credits SET ${ccy} = $1 WHERE uid = $2`, [val, uid]);
 *
 *    Read, compute, overwrite. Two concurrent movements lose one of themselves
 *    even without defect 1. Every movement here is a guarded delta applied by
 *    the wallet, which the database arbitrates.
 *
 * 3. THE IDEMPOTENCY CHECK WAS A READ, NOT A CONSTRAINT
 *
 *    `SELECT ... WHERE transaction_id = $1` and then, much later, an INSERT.
 *    Two retries arriving together both read "not seen" and both paid. The
 *    record is written FIRST here, inside the same transaction as the money, so
 *    the unique index decides.
 *
 * 4. A ROLLBACK REVERSED WHATEVER THE REQUEST NAMED
 *
 *    `for (const tx of rollback_transactions) delta = delta.plus(Big(tx.amount))`
 *    — the figure came from the caller, and a rollback for a transaction we had
 *    never applied still moved money. Reversals use OUR recorded amount, and
 *    something we never applied is not reversed.
 *
 * 5. `X-Timestamp` WAS SIGNED BUT NEVER CHECKED
 *
 *    The signature is sound — HMAC-SHA1 over every parameter — but a captured
 *    request stayed valid forever. It must now be recent.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY NOTHING ON THE CALLBACK PATH THROWS
 *
 * Slotegrator requires HTTP 200 on every response, refusals included, carrying
 * `{error_code, error_description}`. A 4xx with our error envelope is a shape
 * their client cannot read, and it retries on anything it cannot read — an
 * infinite retry loop against a money endpoint. So `handleTransaction` returns
 * a shaped object and never rejects.
 *
 * ── ON `users.casino_gt` ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Legacy mirrored net casino P&L onto that column from inside this handler, for
 * INR and PKR only, so an admin screen could read it without summing. It is not
 * written here: `users` belongs to user-service, and every movement now leaves a
 * ledger row with `source_service` set, so the figure is derivable. The admin
 * report that reads the column needs to derive it instead.

  /**
   * A PLAYER'S OWN ACTIVE FREESPIN CAMPAIGNS — new, no legacy equivalent.
   *
   * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   * THE ONE READ THIS FEATURE NEVER HAD
   *
   * `gis_freespins` has had three routes over it since migration 016 and all
   * three are STAFF routes: grant one, fetch one by campaign id, cancel one.
   * There has never been a way for the player the campaign belongs to to find
   * out that it exists — which is why the front-end's Free Plays dialog has
   * rendered "Free Spins 0" over an empty state since it was built.
   *
   * ── IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE PROVIDER, DELIBERATELY ─────────────────────
   *
   * No `#requireProvider()`. Every other method in this section calls out to
   * Slotegrator and refuses without credentials, which on this delivery means
   * refusing always — no GIS keys are configured (see the deployment notes).
   * But the campaign rows are OURS: `setFreespin` writes them locally after
   * the provider confirms, and `getFreespin` already answers from the local
   * row first and only falls upstream when there is none. So a listing of what
   * we have recorded is answerable today, and gating it on a provider we do
   * not have would make a route that could work refuse for a reason that has
   * nothing to do with it.
   *
   * What that DOES mean is that `quantity_left` is only as fresh as the last
   * callback — the provider decrements it as spins are played. With no
   * provider it never moves. That is a data-staleness limit, not a correctness
   * one, and it is the same limit `getFreespin`'s local arm already has.
   *
   * ── ACTIVE, AND WITHIN ITS WINDOW ────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * `status: 'active'` excludes cancelled campaigns. The `valid_until` test is
   * the one that matters more: an expired campaign is not something a player
   * can act on, and showing it under a "Play Now" button would be the worst
   * kind of empty promise. `valid_from` is checked at the other end for the
   * same reason — a campaign scheduled for next week is not playable now.
   * Nulls pass both, since the columns are nullable and "no window" means "no
   * limit" rather than "never".
   *
   * ── THE GAME IS RESOLVED HERE AND NOT BY THE CALLER ──────────────────
   *
   * A campaign names a `game_uuid` and nothing else; the screen it feeds shows
   * the game's NAME under the campaign title. Resolving it client-side would
   * mean the client holding a copy of the catalogue, so the join is done here
   * across the same two tables `GamesService` uses — the aggregator catalogue
   * and the in-house list. On this delivery the aggregator side is empty (the
   * catalogue is the platform's biggest data gap), so in practice this
   * resolves in-house games and answers `null` for anything else. A null game
   * is rendered rather than dropped: the campaign is real even when we cannot
   * name what it is for.
