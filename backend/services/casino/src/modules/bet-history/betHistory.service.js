/**
 * Casino transaction history — across all four places a bet can live.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE STAFF SCOPE CAME FROM A RAW HEADER, ON UNAUTHENTICATED ROUTES
 *
 *     let ids = await visibleIds(req.headers['x-staff-id']);
 *
 * `x-staff-id: 1` returned every transaction on the platform — every player's
 * stake, win, and balance movement — to anyone who sent the header. There was
 * no token, no signature, and no check that the caller was staff at all.
 *
 * Worse, the tree query treats `1` as the root:
 *
 *     if (ids.includes(1)) val = true;   // ...and then `parent_staff_id IS NULL`
 *
 * so `x-staff-id: 1` ALSO unlocked the rows with no owner, which is the ones
 * that belong to nobody in particular — house accounts and orphans.
 *
 * Here the staff id comes from a verified token, and the visible tree is
 * resolved by admin-service, which owns the `staff` table.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE REPORTS DISAGREED WITH EACH OTHER
 *
 * Five handlers each wrote their own UNION with their own CASE expressions, and
 * they had drifted:
 *
 *   a zero-profit round was `BET` in getTransactionHistory,
 *                          neither win nor loss in getTransactionStats,
 *                          and `bet` in /admin/analytics.
 *
 * So "total transactions" from one endpoint never reconciled against the sum of
 * wins and losses from another. `classify()` in the constants file is the one
 * definition now, and every count here uses it.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * IT FETCHED LIVE HISTORY OVER HTTP FROM ITSELF
 *
 *     const apiResponse = await axios.get('https://api.lagaobet.com/jsGamesv2/historyAdmin');
 *
 * A hard-coded absolute URL to a DIFFERENT DEPLOYMENT of this same codebase,
 * called synchronously inside a paginated report. If that host was slow, this
 * report was slow; if it was down, the report silently returned a page missing
 * a whole category of transactions, because the failure was swallowed:
 *
 *     } catch (apiError) { console.error(...); }   // continue
 *
 * jsGames v2 transactions are in `game_transactions` now — migration 016 — and
 * they are read from the database like every other source.
