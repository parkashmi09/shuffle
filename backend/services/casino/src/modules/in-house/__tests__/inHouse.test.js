/**
 * The in-house games.
 *
 * Most of the game arithmetic is legacy's, ported as-is — so most of these
 * tests PIN what it does rather than assert what it should do. Several of them
 * document behaviour that is almost certainly a bug; they are written that way
 * on purpose, so that changing the behaviour later fails a test and is a
 * decision rather than an accident.
 *
 * FOUR OF THOSE PINS HAVE NOW BEEN RELEASED. Magic Wheel, High Low, Wheel and
 * Single Keno did not depend on chance at all — three won every round and one
 * could not win — and they have been fixed. Their tests now assert the fixed
 * behaviour, and each says what it used to pin. The distinction still holds
 * everywhere else: a test SHOUTING in capitals is pinning a defect, not
 * endorsing it. See `BACKEND-INTEGRATION.md` §8.6.
 *
 * The engine tests are different: the stake path is not ported as-is, and
 * those assert the guarantee.
