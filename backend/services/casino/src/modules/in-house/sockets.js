 * The in-house game socket events.

 * out of its callback pyramid:
 *
 *   1. take the stake and open a bet   (`GameEngine.placeBet`)
 *   2. run the game's own arithmetic    (`games/<name>.js` — unchanged)
 *   3. settle and pay                   (`GameEngine.settle`)
 *
 * Steps 1 and 3 are one transaction each. Step 2 is legacy's, verbatim.
 *
 * ── AND A FAILURE REFUNDS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Several legacy games `assert()` mid-round — `assert(result)` in Limbo,
 * `assert(amount && payout)` in ClassicDice. A failed assert threw between
 * `preparePlay` and `prepareBusted`, so the stake was gone and the bet row sat
 * open forever with no path to close it. Here a throw after the stake is taken
 * refunds it.

 * Tell every connected client that a round settled.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `LAST_BETS`, `TOP_WINNERS` and `GET casino/bet-history/live` are all PULL —
 * they answer a request with the most recent rows, and nothing tells a client
 * that new rows exist. Legacy had no push either; its board moved only when
 * the page asked again. So a live bets feed could only ever be a poll.
 *
 * `BET_SETTLED` is this project's own event (see `PLATFORM_EVENTS` — it is
 * deliberately NOT in the legacy tables) and carries the settled round, so a
 * feed can prepend a row instead of re-reading itself on a timer.
 *
 * ── `nsp.emit`, NOT `socket.broadcast.emit` ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Chat excludes the sender because their own message is already in the reply
 * they get. A bets feed is different: the player who just bet should see their
 * round arrive in the ticker like everyone else's, and the ack that drives
 * their game board is a different surface. So this reaches the sender too.
 *
 * ── FAILURE HERE MUST NOT UNDO A SETTLED ROUND ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The money has already moved by the time this runs. A throw would reach the
 * handler's catch, which refunds — turning a broadcast problem into a paid
 * round being taken back. So it never throws.
