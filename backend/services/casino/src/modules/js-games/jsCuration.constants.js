 * The curated lists an operator can build over `js_games`.
 *
 * ── WHY THESE SLUGS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first five mirror the aggregator collections in `games.constants.js`,
 * so the admin screens keep the vocabulary operators already use. `trending`
 * is new and is the home page's own row — the one the site rendered from a
 * hard-coded file (`src/Pages/homePage/trendingGamesData.js`, twenty games
 * transcribed from a screenshot) with no way for an operator to change it.
 *
 * A collection missing from this list is a 404 rather than an empty list. The
 * difference matters to the caller: "no such collection" is a bug in the
 * caller, "this collection is empty" is a state an operator chose.
