/**
 * Operator actions.
 *
 * `POST /v1/transfer` is the one that mattered: legacy was unauthenticated,
 * took the player from the body, and told the provider to credit that account
 * WITHOUT touching `credits`. Balance appeared at the provider out of nothing.
 *
 * The other two dumped every player's activity to anyone who asked.
 *
 * ── AND A STAFF TOKEN ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH EITHER ───────────────────────
 *
 * Requiring authentication fixed "anyone", but every route here then accepted
 * any staff account regardless of grant — so the transfer was reachable by an
 * executive holding read-only permissions.
 *
 * `wallet:credit` is the right grant for the transfer specifically. It moves
 * balance to a player at the provider, which is the same authority as crediting
 * a wallet directly, and it should cost the same permission — otherwise this
 * route is a way around `wallet:credit` rather than an instance of it.
