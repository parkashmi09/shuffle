 * exists. Legacy answered 'Bad email' and 'Bad password' and skipped the bcrypt
 * compare on the first, so it leaked through all three channels.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * AND SINCE THE SECOND FACTOR LANDED, THE PASSWORD IS NOT THE WHOLE DOOR
 *
 * Players could enrol in TOTP and the player login enforced it. Staff could
 * not — while holding `wallet:credit`, `withdrawals:approve` and `users:lock`
 * over everyone else's balances. The credential with the most authority on the
 * platform was the one protected by a password alone, and phishing a password
 * is the cheapest attack there is.
 *
 * The gate sits AFTER the password is proven and after `#assertUsable`, for the
 * same reason those are ordered that way: whether an account has 2FA on is a
 * fact about that account, and answering it before the password would make
 * this endpoint an oracle for which staff emails exist.
