/**
 * How much a player has wagered on sports, over a period.
 *
 * The sports counterpart to casino-service's module of the same name. See that
 * one for why this is an internal API rather than three copies of the same
 * query scattered through the reward features.
 *
 * ── ONE DIFFERENCE WORTH KNOWING ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `SportsBet` already carries `usd_amount`, converted when the bet was placed.
 * That is the RIGHT number to use — it is what the stake was worth at the
 * moment it was risked, not what it would be worth today. Recomputing it from
 * `original_amount` at a current rate would make a player's historical
 * wagering total drift with the exchange rate, so a condition they had already
 * met could quietly become unmet.
 *
 * So this returns USD directly, where the casino one returns per-currency
 * totals for the caller to convert. The shapes differ because the underlying
 * facts differ, and flattening that would mean throwing away the better one.

   * on a match that settles after it scores nothing — correct, since a player
   * could otherwise stake into a market they expect to be voided and collect
