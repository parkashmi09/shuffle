/**
 * Import the provider game catalogue from `data/js-games.csv`.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY A SEEDER AND NOT THE AGGREGATOR SYNC
 *
 * `POST /casino/gis/sync/games` is how `gisgamesnew` is meant to fill, and it
 * needs Slotegrator credentials this deployment does not have. Until it does,
 * the lobby serves an empty table: `GET /casino/games` answers `200 []`, the
 * provider rail falls back to `src/data/catalog.js`, and every lobby row on the
 * home page stays on its captured copy.
 *
 * This file is the operator-supplied catalogue that stands in for that sync. It
 * is the same data in the same columns; what it does not carry is the
 * aggregator's launch parameters, so importing it fills the LOBBY and not the
 * launch path — see "What this does not do" at the foot of this comment.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE ROWS GO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The dump is shaped for `js_games`, and that is the first target. But nothing
 * in the lobby reads `js_games` — `games.service.js` reads `gisgamesnew` in
 * every listing endpoint and touches `js_games` only in `#resolveGames`, to
 * name a favourite the aggregator no longer carries. So one row is written
 * twice:
 *
 *   js_games      the catalogue as given, column for column. The record of
 *                 what was imported, and what `#resolveGames` already reads.
 *   gisgamesnew   the same row projected into the serving table's shape. This
 *                 is what players see.
 *
 * Writing only the first would import 1,980 games into a table no screen reads.
 *
 * `gis_providers` and `gis_providers_new` take the distinct vendors, because
 * the provider rail (`GET /casino/games/providers`) reads them and not the
 * game rows.
 *
 * ── THE COLLECTIONS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The five lobby rows are curated uuid lists, one row per table. They are
 * filled here by a RULE, stated in `COLLECTION_RULES` below, rather than left
 * empty — an empty collection table means the home page keeps rendering its
 * captured fixture, which is the state this import exists to end.
 *
 * A rule is not curation and is not pretending to be. It is a defensible
 * default an operator replaces from the admin panel the first time they
 * disagree with it; `PUT /casino/games/collections/:name` overwrites the whole
 * list and this seeder never runs again.
 *
 * ── IDS ARE NOT PRESERVED ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The dump carries `id` 343–2471 and this database's `js_games` already holds
 * 1–24, so there is no collision today. They are still dropped: `game_uid` is
 * the unique key and the stable one, ids are assigned per environment, and
 * seeder 002 makes the same point about the in-house rows. Matching on
 * `game_uid` is also what makes this file idempotent — running it twice
 * updates 1,980 rows rather than doubling them.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not make a game OPEN. `/casino/catalogue/launch` and
 * `/casino/gis/launch` post to an aggregator with merchant credentials, and
 * `CASINO_NEXUS_*` / `GIS_MERCHANT_*` are unset. A tile imported here renders,
 * is searchable and can be favourited; clicking it has nowhere to go until
 * those are configured. The catalogue and the launch path are two integrations
 * and this fills one of them.

 *
 * ── WHY THE DEAD ONES ARE SET TO NULL RATHER THAN LEFT ───────────────────
 *
 * A URL that can never load is WORSE than no URL. `imageFor` falls back to the

 * placeholder immediately; a dead link renders nothing, then a broken-image
 * box, and the card sits empty while the browser waits for a host that will
