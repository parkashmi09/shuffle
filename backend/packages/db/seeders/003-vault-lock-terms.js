/**
 * The vault's lock terms.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS SEEDER EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `migrations/010-vault-schema.js` creates `vault_lock_rates` and inserts
 * nothing, and no other seeder fills it. With the table empty:
 *
 *   `GET  /user/vault/lock-options`  answers `200 []`
 *   `POST /user/vault/transfer-in`   throws `LOCK_PERIOD_NOT_FOUND` for every
 *                                    `lockPeriod` a caller can name
 *
 * So the vault reads fine and cannot accept a single deposit — which looks
 * like a broken endpoint rather than an unconfigured product. The wallet's
 * vault modal says so instead of posting into nothing, but a developer running
 * this platform has no way to exercise transfer-in at all.
 *
 * ── THESE ARE DEVELOPMENT DEFAULTS, NOT A PRODUCT DECISION ───────────────
 *
 * Terms and rates are operator configuration: `POST /admin/vault/lock-periods`
 * (CONFIG_WRITE) adds one and `PUT /admin/vault/lock-periods/rate` changes a
 * rate, both audited. An operator setting up a real deployment should use
 * those. What is seeded here is the smallest ladder that makes every path
 * reachable — a no-notice term so a player can move money in and straight back
 * out, and three fixed terms so the matured/immature branches in
 * `transfer-out` can both be hit.
 *
 * The rates are plausible, not researched. They exist so `vault_interest_history`
 * has something to accrue against.
 *
 * `lock_period` is the key the API passes around, and it is UNIQUE — so this is
 * idempotent on it and a term an operator has since edited is left alone.
