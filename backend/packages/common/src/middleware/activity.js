/**
 * Staff activity audit.
 *
 * Replaces `legacy/system/utils/recordActivity`, which wrote directly into
 * `admin_activity_logs` from whichever service happened to be handling the
 * request. Only admin-service owns that table now, so the record goes over the
 * internal API.
 *
 *   router.post('/declare-result',
 *     validate(v.declareResult),
 *     withActivity({
 *       action: 'settle.declare-result',
 *       describe: (req) => ({ targetType: 'MARKET', targetId: req.body.match_id }),
 *     }),
 *     ctrl.declareResult);
 *
 * Two properties matter:
 *
 *   1. It records the OUTCOME, not the attempt. The audit row is written after
 *      the response, carrying the status code, so a rejected settlement is
 *      distinguishable from one that went through. Legacy recorded before the
 *      handler ran, so a 500 left an audit trail claiming the market had been
 *      settled.
 *
 *   2. Audit failure never fails the request. The money movement already
 *      committed; refusing the response because the log write failed would be
 *      strictly worse. It logs at `error` with everything needed to reconstruct
 *      the row by hand.
