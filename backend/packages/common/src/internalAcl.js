/**
 * Which service may call which internal endpoint.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 *
 * `internalAuth` asked one question: "is this THE shared key?". Every service
 * holds the same `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, so the answer was yes for all of them —
 * which means any service could call any internal endpoint on any other. The
 * one that matters:
 *
 *     POST /internal/user/wallet/credit
 *
 * That endpoint mints balance. sports-service and casino-service call it
 * legitimately, to pay out winnings. admin-service and user-service never do.
 * But nothing said so, so a compromise of ANY service — including the one
 * that only reads a sports feed — was a compromise of the wallet.
 *
 * The caller also self-declared its name in `x-internal-service`, and that
 * header was written onto audit rows as "who moved this money". Anyone holding
 * the shared key could claim to be anyone.
 *
 * ── TWO CHANGES, IN ORDER ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. IDENTITY. Each service gets its OWN key. The caller is then identified by
 *    WHICH key verified, not by what it says about itself — so audit
 *    attribution becomes a fact rather than a claim.
 *
 * 2. AUTHORIZATION. Once the caller is known, this table decides what it may
 *    reach.
 *
 * The order matters, and so does the dependency: enforcement is only possible
 * where identity is real. With per-service keys unconfigured the platform
 * falls back to the shared key, the caller is NOT identified, and the ACL is
 * skipped entirely — which keeps a deployment that has not been migrated
 * behaving exactly as it did before. See `internalAuth`.
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
