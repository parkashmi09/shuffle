/**
 * Site policy — the business settings a site's owner chooses, enforced where
 * money and accounts are created.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS IS A GUARD AND NOT A FLAG
 *
 * "This site takes manual deposits only" is a statement about what the
 * platform will ACCEPT, not about what a page draws. A front end that hides
 * the gateway button still leaves the gateway route one request away. So the
 * services that open a deposit, a withdrawal or an account ask here first,
 * and refuse — whatever the page showed.
 *
 * ── UNSET MEANS TODAY'S BEHAVIOUR ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A site that has never chosen reads the permissive default: hybrid, both,
 * both. Shipping this must not close anybody's cashier. Only a stored choice
 * restricts.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NEVER REFUSED HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Provider callbacks, and staff approving or rejecting what is already
 * pending. Money already in flight when a mode changes must still land, and
 * a request already made must still be answerable.
 *
 * Read on every call, no cache — an operator who closes withdrawals during an
 * incident means the next request, not the one after a TTL.
