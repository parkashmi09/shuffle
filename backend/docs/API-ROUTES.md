# API — routes, structure and how to call them

Every HTTP surface the platform serves: how a request is routed, which guard it
meets, what comes back, and where each module lives.

|  |  |
| --- | ---: |
| Services | 4 + gateway |
| Modules | 66 |
| Routes mounted | 587 |
| Error codes declared | 56 catalogues |
| Legacy routes ported | 555 / 577 (96.2%) |

Both appendices are **generated**, and everything above them is hand-written:

| Command | Rewrites | From |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `node tools/api-surface.js` | Appendix A — every mounted route, its guard and its response shape | The service source: manifests, route files, controllers, error catalogues |
| `node tools/route-inventory.js` | Appendix B — the legacy port checklist | The `@legacy` tags in the source |

`node tools/api-surface.js --check` fails if Appendix A no longer matches the
code, and `--json` writes the same data to `docs/api-surface.json` for anything
that would rather read it than the table.

## 1. Where to send a request

**Everything goes to the gateway.** In development that is
`http://127.0.0.1:4000`. The four services listen on 4001–4004, but those ports
are an implementation detail — nothing outside the cluster should address them,
and `/internal/*` is refused at the gateway outright.

```text
https://api.example.com
  /health                     aggregated platform health
  /api/v1                     endpoint index
  /api/v1/<service>/...       public and player routes
  /api/v1/admin/<service>/... staff routes
```

The service segment is part of the path, so routing is a prefix match with no
lookup table:

| Prefix | Reaches |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/v1/user/...` | user-service :4001 |
| `/api/v1/casino/...` | casino-service :4003 |
| `/api/v1/sports/...` | sports-service :4004 |
| `/api/v1/admin/...` | admin-service :4002, **or** another service's admin routes |
| `/internal/...` | **refused at the gateway** — cluster-internal only |

`/api/v1/admin/user/vault` is user-service's admin router, not admin-service. The
`admin` segment names the *audience*; the segment after it names the service that
owns the data. admin-service's own modules skip the repetition —
`/api/v1/admin/players`, not `/api/v1/admin/admin/players`.

### A worked example

```bash
# Public — no token
curl localhost:4000/api/v1/casino/games

# Player — bearer token
curl localhost:4000/api/v1/user/wallet \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <player access token>'

# Staff — staff token, and the route also checks a permission
curl localhost:4000/api/v1/admin/user/vault/users \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <staff token>'

# Internal — never reachable from outside
curl localhost:4001/internal/user/wallet/debit \
     -H 'x-internal-key: <INTERNAL_API_KEY>' \
     -H 'x-internal-service: casino-service' \
     -d '{...}'
```

---

## 2. The four audiences

A module declares its routers by audience, and **the loader attaches the guard**
— a route handler never performs its own auth check:

| Audience | Mounts at | Guard | Sets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `public` | `/api/v1/<service><basePath>` | none | — |
| `user` | `/api/v1/<service><basePath>` | player token | `req.user` |
| `admin` | `/api/v1/admin/<service><basePath>` | staff token + permission | `req.staff` |
| `internal` | `/internal/<service><basePath>` | internal key | `req.internalService` |

**`public` is an audience, not a path segment.** A public router and a user
router mount at the *same* path — one carries a guard, the other does not. So
`GET /api/v1/user/crypto/networks` (public) and
`GET /api/v1/user/crypto/addresses` (player) sit side by side.

A module that declares `user`, `admin` or `internal` routes and is mounted
without the matching guard **fails at boot** rather than serving an
unauthenticated surface. That is the property the loader exists for.

### Why this matters

In the source this replaces, the guard was a line you remembered to type:

```js
router.post('/createBlog', upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
```

No middleware. The same shape produced `POST /reports/export` returning every
player's name, referral code and balance to anyone who asked, and 21 P2P routes
— thirteen of them under `/admin/p2p/` — with none at all. Here the audience is
a property of the file the router lives in, and the guard comes with it.

---

## 3. Authentication

### Players

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access token>
```

`POST /api/v1/user/auth/login` returns an access token and a refresh token.
Access tokens are short-lived; rotate with `POST /api/v1/user/auth/refresh`.

Two token families with two secrets: a leaked player secret cannot mint a staff
token. `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` and `JWT_ADMIN_SECRET` are
separate values and the `TokenService` refuses to construct without them.

### Staff

```http
Authorization: Bearer <staff token>
```

`POST /api/v1/admin/auth/login`. Permissions are resolved from the **current**
database role on every request, so a demoted account loses access immediately
rather than when its token expires. Routes declare what they need:

```js
router.post('/', auth.requirePermission(PERMISSIONS.CONFIG_WRITE), ...);
```

### Internal

```http
x-internal-key: <INTERNAL_API_KEY>
x-internal-service: casino-service
```

Never proxied by the gateway. A request arriving at `/internal/*` from outside
the cluster is refused before it reaches a service.

### What the gateway strips

Any inbound `x-user-id`, `x-staff-id` or `x-internal-*` header is removed at the
edge before proxying. Legacy read `x-staff-id` straight off the request on the
deposit-report routes — a header anyone can set, naming the operator whose data
you get back.

---

## 4. The response envelope

One shape, everywhere:

```jsonc
// success — `meta` is present only when the handler passes one
{ "success": true, "data": { }, "meta": { } }

// failure — `details.requestId` is ALWAYS there; it is what to quote in a bug report
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "WALLET_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS",
                               "message": "Not enough balance",
                               "details": { "requestId": "c1f0…" } } }
```

`data` is whatever the handler passed — an object, an array, a string, or
`null`. It is never absent on a success, so `body.data` is always safe to read.

| Helper | Status | Body | Used for |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `response.ok(res, data, meta?)` | 200 | `{success, data, meta?}` | Reads and updates |
| `response.created(res, data, meta?)` | 201 | `{success, data, meta?}` | Something new exists |
| `response.accepted(res, data, meta?)` | 202 | `{success, data, meta?}` | Queued, not finished |
| `response.noContent(res)` | 204 | **empty** — no body at all | Deletes that return nothing |
| `response.paginated(res, rows, pagination, extraMeta?)` | 200 | `{success, data: [], meta.pagination}` | Lists — see §6 |
| `response.fail(res, status, code, message, details?)` | given | `{success: false, error}` | Answering a failure without throwing |

**204 carries no body.** Do not parse one — `res.status(204).end()` sends zero
bytes, and `JSON.parse('')` throws. Branch on the status first.

**The success status is meaningful, and one route uses it.**
`POST /api/v1/admin/user/bonus/games` answers `201` when the row was created and
`200` when it was already there — a second call is not a second row, which is
what the unique key is for. Anywhere the Appendix A tables list two entries for
one route, the handler chooses between them on a condition like that.

### The routes that answer outside it

Fifty-five do, in three families, and every one of them says why at the handler.
They are marked **raw** in the Appendix A tables, so the list below is the shape
of the exception rather than something to keep in sync by hand.

| Family | Count | What comes back | Why |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Binary and documents | 18 | The bytes, with a detected `Content-Type` | They are `<img>` targets, PDF downloads and one CSV export. An envelope around a JPEG helps nobody. |
| Provider callbacks | 19 | The provider's own envelope, HTTP 200 even for a refusal | Aggregator clients retry on anything they cannot parse. A 4xx carrying our error envelope is an infinite retry loop against a money endpoint. |
| Legacy-shaped JSON | 18 | `{success, data}`, `{history, count}`, `{success, message, …}` | An existing client parses that exact object. Fields were added, none renamed. |

The provider family covers `x-casino`, `seamless`, `gis/callback/transactions`,
`js-games` v1 and v2, the three `aggregators` callbacks, the CCPayment callback
and both PSP callbacks. The legacy-shaped family is `sports/settlement` (11),
`POST /api/v1/sports/bets`, and wallet `history` on both the player and staff
side.

`POST /api/v1/sports/bets` is the sharpest of them: it hand-rolls its own
envelope **and** its own error handling — `200 {success, exposure,
balanceDelta, oldBalance, newBalance, totalExposure}`, `400 {success: false,
message}` for anything that threw — because the betting board on the other end
parses that and nothing else. It is the one route in the platform where a
failure does not reach the shared error handler.

---

## 5. Errors

Every error is declared with a namespace, a stable code and a status:

```js
module.exports = defineErrors('WALLET', {
  INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS: { status: 402, message: 'Not enough balance' },
});
// → code "WALLET_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"
```

Duplicates are detected at boot. Clients should branch on `error.code`, never on
`error.message` — the message is for a human and may be reworded.

**Every module's catalogue is listed in [Appendix A](#appendix-a--the-live-api-surface)**
— 56 namespaces, with the status and message beside each code. Errors are thrown
from the service layer, so any code in a module's catalogue is reachable from any
route in that module.

| Status | Means |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | The request is malformed, or changed nothing |
| 401 | No token, or it did not verify |
| 402 | Not enough balance |
| 403 | Authenticated, but not allowed — or the account is locked |
| 404 | No such thing **or not yours** — deliberately the same answer |
| 409 | State conflict: already settled, already claimed, already open |
| 413 / 415 | Upload too large / not an accepted image |
| 422 | Well-formed but unacceptable: unknown currency, below a minimum |
| 429 | Rate limited |
| 502 / 503 | A provider failed, or an integration is not configured |

**404 covers "not yours".** A P2P order that belongs to somebody else answers
exactly as one that does not exist. Distinguishing them turns the endpoint into
an oracle for which ids are real.

### The codes every route can return

These come from the shared middleware rather than any module catalogue, so no
route declares them and every route can produce them:

| Status | Code | When | Extra `details` |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `BAD_REQUEST` | A handler rejected the input itself | — |
| 400 | `MALFORMED_JSON` | The body is not valid JSON | — |
| 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED` | No token, expired, wrong secret; or a bad internal key | — |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | Missing permission, locked account, or acting on an account at or above your own level | — |
| 403 | `INVALID_CSRF_TOKEN` | CSRF check failed | — |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | No route matched — and the terminal handler names the method and path | — |
| 409 | `CONFLICT` | Unique constraint | `fields[]` |
| 409 | `FOREIGN_KEY_VIOLATION` | Referenced row does not exist | — |
| 413 | `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` | Body over the limit | — |
| 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | A zod schema rejected the request | `fields[]` |
| 429 | `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` | Rate limited — a `Retry-After` header comes with it | `retryAfter`, `bucket` |
| 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Anything unhandled. The real error is logged, never sent | `stack[]` in dev only |
| 500 | `DATABASE_ERROR` | A database error — the SQL is deliberately not surfaced | — |
| 503 | `DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE` | Cannot reach the database | — |
| 504 | `DATABASE_TIMEOUT` | Query timed out | — |

A validation failure carries the offending fields, so a form can mark them
without parsing prose:

```jsonc
{ "success": false,
  "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "message": "Validation failed",
             "details": { "requestId": "c1f0…",
                          "fields": [ { "field": "amount",   "message": "amount must be greater than zero", "code": "too_small" },
                                      { "field": "query.limit", "message": "Number must be less than or equal to 100", "code": "too_big" } ] } } }
```

The `field` is dotted and names the request part it came from — `query.limit`,
`params.id` — except for the body, whose prefix is stripped because that is where
a form's field names already live.

**Validation strips unknown keys.** The parsed result replaces `req.body`,
`req.query` and `req.params`, so an extra field is not an error — it is simply
gone by the time a handler runs. Nothing can be smuggled past a schema by adding
a key to it.

---

## 6. Pagination, filtering and money

**Two request conventions, one response shape.** Most lists take `limit` and
`offset`; nine modules take `page` and `limit` instead. Which one a route wants
is in its validator, and sending the wrong pair is not an error — the unknown key
is stripped and the default applies, so you get page one rather than a 422. The
Appendix A tables mark every paginated route, and a `400`/`422` is what you get
only if the value itself is out of range.

```http
GET /api/v1/user/p2p/orders?page=2&limit=25          # page-based: blogs, gis, games,
                                                     # js-games, statements, x-gaming,
                                                     # bet-history, deposit-reports, p2p
GET /api/v1/user/wallet/ledger?limit=25&offset=25    # offset-based: everything else
```

The answer is the same either way — `data` is the rows, and everything about the
page is under **`meta.pagination`**:

```jsonc
{ "success": true,
  "data": [ /* rows */ ],
  "meta": { "pagination": { "page": 2, "limit": 25, "total": 137,
                            "totalPages": 6, "hasNext": true, "hasPrev": true } } }
```

`page` is reported even on an offset-based route — it is derived as
`floor(offset / limit) + 1`. There is no `meta.total` at the top level; read
`meta.pagination.total`.

A route may add its own keys beside `pagination` (a `summary`, a set of totals);
nothing is ever removed.

Every list is capped — commonly at 100 or 200 rows, per validator. Legacy's
`GET /all` selected every blog row including every full article body, unpaged, on
an unauthenticated route.

**Money is always a string**, in and out — `"12.50000000"`, never `12.5`.
Balances are `NUMERIC(30,8)`; a JSON number cannot carry that precision, and
`0.1 + 0.2` in a float is not `0.3`. Amounts are validated as decimals with up
to eight places and converted to `BigInt` minor units internally.

Date ranges use `from` and `to` as ISO-8601.

---

## 7. Uploads

`multipart/form-data`, one file per request, through
`@ibitplay/common/imageUpload`:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Accepted | PNG, JPEG, WebP — **by magic bytes**, never by filename or declared MIME |
| Refused | SVG, explicitly — it can carry `<script>` and would run on the platform origin |
| Max | 4 MB |
| Stored | In the row (`BYTEA`), not on disk |
| Served | `GET .../:id/image` with the **detected** content type and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` |

Three modules take images — `banners`, `blogs` and `p2p` — and all three had the
same defect: the format was judged from `file.mimetype` or
`path.extname(file.originalname)`, both chosen by the uploader. Declaring
`image/png` while naming the file `x.html` put an HTML document in a
statically-served directory on the platform's own origin.

The bytes live in the row because local disk is not shared between replicas: an
upload landing on one server was a 404 from the next, intermittently, and the
whole directory was lost on restart. For a payment proof — the evidence in a
dispute over real money — that is the difference between having a record and not.

---

## 8. The module map

Every module, its base path and which audiences it exposes. Combine the base
path with the audience prefix from §2 to get the URL.

For example `vault` exposes `player` and `staff`, so it serves
`/api/v1/user/vault/*` and `/api/v1/admin/user/vault/*`.

For the routes themselves — every path, its guard and what it answers with — go
to [Appendix A](#appendix-a--the-live-api-surface); this table is the index over
it.

## 9. Service-to-service calls

A service that needs something outside its own model domains asks over
`/internal/...` with the internal key. It never reaches into another service's
tables.

| Caller | Endpoint | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| casino, sports | `POST /internal/user/wallet/debit` · `/credit` | **Every** balance change |
| casino, sports | `GET /internal/user/wallet/balance` | A player's balance |
| user | `GET /internal/admin/auth/verify` | Is this staff id still active? |
| user | `POST /internal/admin/notifications/*` | A player's own notifications |
| admin | `GET /internal/sports/bet-admin/net` | Net sports exposure |
| admin | `GET /internal/casino/wager/turnover/:id` · `/internal/sports/...` | Turnover for a statement |
| sports | `GET /internal/user/exchange-rate` | Converting a stake |

**All money moves through user-service.** Casino and sports never write
`credits`, so the row locking, ledger writes and idempotency rules exist in
exactly one place rather than three that drift.

Every movement carries an idempotency key derived from the thing being paid for
— `p2p-buy-release:P2PA1B2C3`, `vault-out:1471` — so a retry after a timeout
returns the original ledger row instead of paying twice.

---

## 10. Legacy compatibility

Existing clients do not have to change. The gateway rewrites the old path onto
the new one:

```js
// gateway/src/legacyRoutes.js
'POST /api/gis/games/init': '/api/v1/casino/gis/launch',
'GET  /sportsbooks':        '/api/v1/casino/sportsbook',
'POST /createBlog':         '/api/v1/admin/blogs',
```

`npm run verify:modules` fails if any rewrite points at a route that is not
mounted, so the table cannot drift away from the services.

### What changed for a client

Three things, and each has a reason at the mapping site:

1. **Some routes now need a token.** `POST /api/gis/games/init` took `player_id`
   from the request body on an unauthenticated route — one POST opened a
   real-money session on any account. The id comes from the token now, so a
   client calling it must send one.

2. **Two syncs became POSTs.** They were GETs that wrote hundreds of rows, so a
   browser prefetch could trigger a catalogue rebuild.

3. **A path parameter replaced a query string or body field** wherever the old
   route carried its key that way. `POST /updateBlog?id=5` is
   `PATCH /api/v1/admin/blogs/5`. The exact-match table cannot express these, so
   they are listed as comments beside the block they belong to.

### Deliberately not mapped

| Legacy | Why there is no replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /pedramx` · `new_query` | Arbitrary SQL. The socket version was authorised by a boolean in the caller's own message. Already disabled on the live box by `legacy-hotfix/`. |
| `GET /sportsbooks/launch?url=` | Fetched any URL server-side and returned the body — cloud metadata, anything on localhost — forwarding the caller's IP. `init` returns the launch URL; the browser opens it. |
| `POST /uploadImage` | Wrote bytes to a publicly-served directory with no row pointing at them, so an orphan could never be found or cleaned up. An image is a field on a post now. |
| `DELETE /admin/p2p/order/:id` | A bare DELETE with no status check. Removing a RELEASED order destroys the only record that crypto was paid out, while the ledger row survives with nothing to reconcile against. |

A rewrite would imply the capability moved somewhere. It did not.

## Appendix A — the live API surface

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: node tools/api-surface.js -->

Every route the four services mount today, with the guard the loader
attaches and the shape the handler answers with. Regenerate with
`node tools/api-surface.js`.

| | |
| --- | ---: |
| Routes mounted | 613 |
| Modules | 69 |
| Answering outside the envelope | 55 |

**Guard** is the audience the loader mounted the router under, plus anything
the route adds. `public` carries no token. `player` and `staff` carry one.
A grant string — `wallet:credit` — is checked against the caller's CURRENT
database role on every request. `self-only` marks the loader's documented
exemption: a staff write that takes no account id because it acts on the
caller's own session, where a grant would protect nothing.

**Response** reads as `status` `shape`. A shape in braces is an object literal
in the source with those top-level keys; a bare name is the expression the
handler passes, and its shape is whatever that function returns. `[…]` with
`meta.pagination` is the list envelope from §6. **raw** means the route answers
outside the platform envelope — §4 says which families do and why.

More than one entry means the route answers differently depending on a
condition in the handler, listed in source order — the first is the main path.
A binary route shows its `Content-Type` and then the send. Failures are not
listed per route: they are thrown from the service layer, so a module's whole
error catalogue is reachable from every route in it, and the catalogues are at
the end of this appendix.

### Error catalogues

Each module declares every failure it can produce. A code is stable; the
message beside it is for a human and may be reworded. Errors are thrown from
the service layer, so a code is reachable from any route in its module.

## Appendix B — every legacy route

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: node tools/route-inventory.js -->

Every route in `legacy/`, grouped by the service that will own it.

**All of these work today.** They are live in `legacy/` and serving
traffic. The marker says where a route is *served from*, not whether it
functions — **555 / 577** migrated so far (96.2%).

| | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Migrated to the new services. The old path still works, through the gateway. |
| ⬜ | Still served by `legacy/`. Working — not yet migrated. |
